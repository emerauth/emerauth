# How to contribute to Emerauth

Contributions are always welcome! However, in order for us to deliver good, well documented and working software, there are some guidelines we ask you to adhere when contributing to Emerauth's codebases.

## Have you found a bug?

Then please open an issue ticket at Emerauth's [Issue Tab](https://github.com/emerauth/emerauth/issues).

## Have you thought about a new feature that Emerauth could incorporate?

Then please open a discussion at Emerauth's [Discussion Tab](https://github.com/emerauth/emerauth/discussions) and let us know of your ideas.

### After discussing with us, you wrote the feature yourself?

Great! We're delighted. Please open a [Pull Request](https://github.com/emerauth/emerauth/pulls) with your patches.

### Have you written the feature without opening the discussion?

Don't worry. Please open a discussion anyways, and wait a bit, and then send your patch by opening a [Pull Request](https://github.com/emerauth/emerauth/pulls).

#### Why is that?

This is because we acknowledge a visible difference between the time a feature is being discussed (without code) and how the discussion warps from the moment code appears. While the patch is being discussed as pure concepts, we're more free to visualize changes that might not appear when code is around.

After a patch is submitted via a Pull Request, the conversations about the feature becomes more centred around the code than the feature itself. Btw, this is not bad, we just want to separate those moments`.

## Do you have any questions about the source code?

Please open a discussion with your doubts at the [Discussion Tab](https://github.com/emerauth/emerauth/discussions).
